    <p>
        <b>Color by attribute</b>: It is possible to select categorical and continuous attributes, if the attributes are
        categorical the tool allows the color customization for each attribute, if continuous it is possible to choose
        the
        colors of the interval between the minimum and maximum value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>hierarchies and Size:</b> In hierarchical views the tool allows adding, removing, and deciding the order of
        hierarchies and also deciding which attribute will define the size of each item.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Default Colors:</b> Configuration of highlight colors and standard colors Definition of the highlight colors
        and
        standard colors for generating the visualizations.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Filter</b> filter by means of both categorical and continuous attributes,
        if a categorical attribute is chosen a selection button is provided with the options for each attribute, if the
        attribute is continuous, a slider with the range between maximum and minimum value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Filter dimension</b> Filter in one dimension of data: Also in visualizations such as scatterplot, barchart,
        histogram, for multivariate data a filter was implemented in one dimension of data reducing the visualization
        and giving greater emphasis on the parts of interest
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Selection</b> a selection by means of mouse interaction, creating a loop similar to drawing tools and which
        data is below that of the selection will be selected and highlighted as well as data with similar attributes or
        linked to the selected attributes, the selections offered can be made using the following geometric primitives:
        lines, bezier curves, and polygonal geometric shapes. These forms of interactions through graphic primitives
        were selected because they allow their use in different types of visualizations, offering an execution with pros
        and cons depending on the visualization, even so it still remains useful for the purpose.
